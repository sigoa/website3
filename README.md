Stupid idea to mix frozen-extension with flatpages-extension in one project to demo github free hosting.
See the clown at https://github.com/sloria/flask-ghpages-example providing nothing but confusion. The guy didn't know what he was doing, his readme is worthless. The github-pages webserver will serve static html pages only - no python stuff, no frozen stuff asf..
